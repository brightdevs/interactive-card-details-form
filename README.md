## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Typescript

### What I learned

Throught this project many aha moments were learned. Starting with using Typescript, it was a great learning experience. Type casting was quite a challenge trying to figure out what to use when adding the envents listeners to the elements. I am very happy with the result, even though am only using an image as reference it was very helpful.

Take away moments:
* Accessing properties from the object had to be manipulated many times to get the correct value, ` const target = e.target as HTMLInputElement; `
* On the next project my idea is to use rems instead of px for the font sizes, but I am not sure if it will work on all devices.
* On the CSS department feels I am having a better control of the propoerties using the BEM methodology.
```css
.label-wrapper {
                @include flex(column, flex-start, flex-start);
                padding: 0px 10px 0 10px;

                label {
                    font-size: 14px;
                    color: $very-dark-violet;
                    margin: 0 0 5px 0;

                }

                input {
                    height: 40px;
                    border: 1px solid $light-grayish-violet;
                    border-radius: 5px;
                    padding: 0 10px;
                    font-size: 18px;

                    &:focus {
                        outline: 1px solid $very-dark-violet;
                        border-image-source: $liner-gradient-active-input;
                        border-width: 1px;
                        border-image-slice: 1;
                        border-radius: 5px !important;
                    }
                }
```

* Trying to keep up my Typescript knowledge, I had to use the ` as HTMLInputElement ` to access the properties of the element.
```typescript
 ccNumber.addEventListener('keydown', function (e) {
    const target = e.target as HTMLInputElement;
    if (target.value.length === 4) {
        target.value = target.value + ' ';
    }
```
* The event coming downn from the callback function was a bit tricky to understand at first.




### Continued development

There are many features I would like to add to this project. But due to time constraints I am not sure if I will be able to add them all.

### Useful resources

- [typescript resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me figure out the type guards :). I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [typescript resouce 2](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/typescript-event-target-type) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally get over blocked moments when using event listeners in typescript. I'd recommend it to anyone still digesting this concept.
